The report gathers data from the American labor force, explicitly focusing on males and females above the working age of 16 and up to 75 years and older. The analysis was done by obtaining Labor Force data from the U.S. Department of Labor. The data includes the years 2002, 2012, and 2023 and forecasts for the year 2032. The objective of the report is to confirm the claim that the number of young men in the workforce has been decreasing over the past decade (Zinkula & Lalljee, 2023).
